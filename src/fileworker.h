// fileworker.h
//
// Defines a simple background worker that processes file move tasks on a
// separate thread. Utilizes a threadâ€‘safe queue guarded by a mutex and
// condition variable. The worker continually waits for tasks to be
// available and performs file operations without blocking the UI.
